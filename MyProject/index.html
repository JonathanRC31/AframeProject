          <li>Shoot the balloons in the game booth</li>
          <li>Shoot the moving targets in the game booth or in the sky</li>
          <li>Knock cups over by shooting them</li>
          <li>Knock down the small ball in the plinko game and hope you get points</li>
          <li>Play wack-a-mole by shooting the brown ball</li>
        </ol>
